        <p>My name is Jack Hogan, and I am an undergrad student at WPI studying computer science. I have a budding curiosity in the potential of computing, and would like to be present for its promising future.<br /></p>

        <h1>Design Manifesto: </h1>
        <p>I am a perfectionist at heart. I care much less about having a final product then I do about making sure each cog in the system is as efficient and clean as I can get it. From this, it is clear that this class was my worst nightmare. The concept of a design sprint was not something I enjoyed before this class. The contrast drawn between my tendencies and the demands of the assignments helped me develop several design habits that I believe have made me into a more effective designer.
        </p>
        <p>The most challenging aspect of this course was learning a new software almost twice a week. The best example of this was design for understanding. The prompt was fairly simple, create a chart that displays data in a non-biased way. From a design perspective it is a directed task, one with a right answer, which is rarely the case in design. We jumped right into brainstorming ideas and ended up with some complex, but useful concepts. The design process was then brought to a halt when we started to use vega. The software seemed clunky and the language was not intuitive. The development stage of our design sprint consisted of one concession after another. Our problem was that, although our brainstorm was diverse and thorough, it was too idealistic for the time frame and medium. Rather than brainstorming completely freely, I now take an analytical look at the medium that I will be working with to get a realistic idea of its inherent restrictions and of the restrictions that I must impose on myself given my skill and time frame. This approach shone through in my later design, design for wellbeing. 
        </p>
        <p>Interpreting the prompt is a subjective task that I took for granted too often while working on these design sprints. Each prompt gave less and less direction. As I said before, the design for understanding prompt was very direct. However, this last prompt does not have a direction at all, just a medium! Defining, or redefining the design goal has become the most important, and improved aspect of my design philosophy. Perfecting a design on a topic that is so broad is impossible. Take design for wellbeing as an example. “Use an emotional recognition software to make your users lives better”. Perfecting that concept is impossible given any timeframe let alone one week. But if I define the prompt as a simplified version of the goals it outlines the process gets easier. Define it as, make your users happy, instead. Now, that is still a very challenging prompt to perfect. So define it further as, make your user smile, or laugh, or have fun. Now the prompt is beginning to look like something much more manageable, a fun game perhaps, which is exactly what we made! By defining a more simple goal within the overall goal, we were able to generate a design concept simple enough that given the one week we did not have to make any concessions on the original brainstorm. In fact, we ended up having time to add things we hadn’t discussed at all. I was able to apply my perfectionist mentality to the design sprint because of the way that we interpreted the prompt.
</p>
        <p>The first two aspects of my design manifesto have to do mostly with the brainstorming portion of the project, or earlier. If I were designing a brain computer interface I would have to apply both of the techniques above to come away with some manageable ideas for design. But the bulk of the work will still be ahead of me. That is where the importance of group management comes into play. I was hesitant to add this as part of my design manifesto. But most design projects will be done on a team, and coordination my teammates was a huge area of success for many of my projects. There is no shame in focusing on what you are good at during one of these sprints. If I am building a brain interface with a computer scientist, a brain surgeon and a journalist, I’m not gonna have the computer scientist off doing PR while the journalist is sitting behind the computer trying to write ‘hello world’. During these sprints I had to play both roles, the back-end and the front-end. In design for others, I had two group members who were proficient in photoshop, the program we decided to use to design our individual web pages. So there was no reason for me to struggle through one portion of a page while they each do several and come fix mine anyway. This may seem obvious, but a lack of communication can really slow down a groups efficiency. Not only does it impact efficiency,  but it also means that not one person's vision can be realized 100%. 
</p>
<p>Although the work is divided, you are all still working towards the same concept that was generated during the initial phase of the sprint. The only times that foundational changes are made to the design are when the medium gets in the way of a seminal portion of your design, or during user testing. Without user testing you are essentially designing blind, with no awareness of the rabbit hole that you may be traveling down. Designing a brain computer interface, I would user test every possible stage of the design several times. I spent hours on design for tension trying to make it flow better, but it only took a user about one minute to point out that if I just broke up the things I said in one block it will sound a lot better. He was right! Getting eyes on my designs was the single most important method of design revision I used. 
</p>
<p>Finally, there is something to be said for the very end of the design process where you touch up the look and feel of the project. On almost every single spring we focused on designing functionality. We user tested functionality, and we spent most of our time working on the design making the thing actually work. However, I learned that a good touch up can impact the user experience at a much higher ratio of work to pay off than certain back-end aspects of designing. For example, during design for wellbeing, our game timer does not run in seconds. We realized it would be a fair amount of work to get it to run in seconds rather than program ticks. So instead we focused on making the game pretty, and it went over really well in user testing. I learned to let go of certain back end things in place of working on making the front end more attractive to the user. Building a brain interface, I would design a landing page for the user early on so as I said, I could user test all the aspects of the design. But this way I would be able to provide an aesthetic to the user regardless of the robustness of the actual design. 
</p>
<p>The sprints did not change the way I see my designs. I learned tools to curtail the process to myself, and I learned areas that I need to concede certain aspects of the design to the demands of reality. There was improvement through the entire design process. Building a brain interface, I would try to implement every one of the ideas talked about previously. Only one design strung together more than one of the five design points, and that one was far and away the most successful.
